# A-Star-Pathfinding-Java
This repository implements the A* (A-star) algorithm to find the shortest and most efficient path between two nodes on a grid, while avoiding obstacles. The algorithm evaluates possible paths by balancing the shortest distance traveled and the estimated cost to reach the goal.
